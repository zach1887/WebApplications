//when the number of cigars is between 40 and 60, inclusive. Unless it is the weekend, in which case 
//there is no upper bound on the number of cigars. Return true if the party with the given values is 
//successful, or false otherwise.

//problem 02
//You and your date are trying to get a table at a restaurant. The parameter "you" is the stylishness 
//of your clothes, in the range 0..10, and "date" is the stylishness of your date's clothes. The result 
//getting the table is encoded as an int value with 0=no, 1=maybe, 2=yes. If either of you is very stylish, 
//8 or more, then the result is 2 (yes). With the exception that if either of you has style of 2 or less, 
//then the result is 0 (no). Otherwise the result is 1 (maybe).

//    problem 03
//    The children in Cleveland spend most of the day playing outside. In particular, 
//            they play if the temperature is between 60 and 90 (inclusive). Unless it is 
//                    summer, then the upper limit is 100 instead of 90. Given an int 
//                            temperature and a boolean isSummer, return true if the

//  1=small ticket, 2=big ticket. If speed is 60 or less, the result is 0.     
//If speed is between 61 and 80 inclusive, the result is 1. If speed is 81 or more, the result is 2.
